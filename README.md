This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of student demographics and mental health metrics. Utilizing SQL, the project extracts and manipulates data from a relational database to identify trends and correlations between various factors such as length of stay, depression scores (PHQ-9), social connectedness (SCS), and acculturative stress (ASISS) among international students. The insights generated aim to improve student support services by providing a better understanding of the mental health challenges faced by international students.
